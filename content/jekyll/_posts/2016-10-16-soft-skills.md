I read the following book written by John Sonmez.

[SOFT SKILLS](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Soft-Skills-Software-Developers-Manual/dp/1617292397)

I quote a summary from Amazon's introduction as below.

> "Soft Skills: The software developer's life manual" is a unique guide,
offering techniques and practices for a more satisfying life as a professional software developer.
In it, developer and life coach John Sonmez addresses a wide range of important "soft" topics,
from career and productivity to personal finance and investing,
and even fitness and relationships, all from a developer-centric viewpoint.

I'll leave some memos regarding to topics which I feel
interesting in the book.

#### **Marketing**
In general, software developers are not good at self marketing,
but it loses a lot of chances.

Blog, YouTube, writing books, lectures are good opportunities to do your marketing.

Actually, I started this blog by this book's influence :)

#### **Work Efficiency**
I'm used to work recently, so I didn't think about my work efficiency.
However I read this book, and I became thinking that.

Pomodoro technique is recommended in this book, so I'm using it,
and found it good.

#### **Goal Management**
Quota is to help us to continue some tasks.
For example, running three times every weeks.
It's like just a personal goal, but quota has these rules.

- Choose a repeatable task
- Decide the duration and how many times you do the task in the duration
- Adjust the difficulty

#### **Asset Management**
In this book, software developers should utilize their assets.
Because they are relatively smart, so can easily understand
the system of stock market, real estates.

I didn't think having real estates, but I became interested in it.

I also thought that I have to consider my planning of retirement from now.

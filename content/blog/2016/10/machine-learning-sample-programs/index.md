I'm creating sample code collection of machine learning,
this is the repository.

[ML Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/saitoxu/ml-kitchen-sink)

Generally, machine learning programs are written in Python, R,
because these languages have a lot of useful libraries for machine learning.

But I want to study these algorithms deeply,
so I'm creating them in JavaScript (Node.js) for my study.

I'll introduce you these algorithms soon in this blog.

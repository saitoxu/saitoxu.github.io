My name is Yosuke Saito, I'm a web developer living in Tokyo, Japan.

I like web technology, so in this blog, I'd like to write about it widely.

I am also interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, deep learning and so on.
I'm a beginner in the field,
but I'll share my study about that in this blog.

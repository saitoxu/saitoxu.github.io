Gulp has `watch` method as default.

This method watches changes of specified files,
and executes tasks which you want to do automatically.

Usage is below.

```js
gulp.watch(['files you want to watch'], ['tasks you want to do'])
```

Let's create task which watches the change of SCSS file and compile it
by using [the previous post sample]({{ site.baseurl }}/2016/10/29/gulp-first-step.html).

#### **Step 1**
Fisrt, add a task to `gulpfile.js`.

```js
// gulpfile.js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const sass = require('gulp-sass');

gulp.task('watch', () => {
  gulp.watch(['*.scss'], ['scss']);
});

gulp.task('scss', () => {
  gulp.src('*.scss')
    .pipe(sass())
    .pipe(gulp.dest(''));
});
```

#### **Step 2**
Next, execute the following command.

```sh
$ gulp watch
```

#### **Step 3**
Finally, let's change `style.scss`.

You can find that `scss` task is automatically done as below.

```sh
[22:08:16] Starting 'watch'...
[22:08:16] Finished 'watch' after 14 ms
[22:08:30] Starting 'scss'...
[22:08:30] Finished 'scss' after 15 ms
```
